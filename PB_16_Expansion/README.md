# PB 16 Expansion

The PB16 Expansion is a compact version of the PB16 with only two Expansion Headers. It can be used with any PB16 Family Expansion or Falcon Expansion Boards. There is also an optional [serial breakout board](../PB_16_E682_Serial/README.md) for DMX capability. All the design files are open source and available on github.
